    <p>444 hydruto lons are coming to hedera blockchain on a yet to be announced date yet, the executives made an announcment that the 444 collections might be wl only
    <br>This news drew thousands of people looking for the whitelist so they can be part of the chosen ones for the rescue mission on the hedera blockchain<br>
    they started showing their different skills, some of which are tagging people, generating likes, creating threads, doing hourly challenges, being lucky and so on.
    <br>Adminst this confusion, me the person of adekola robiat thought about what skill i was good at , and then remembered a skill i learnt this semester from my mentor, "website designing". Tho my skills in this aspect can be regarded as baby steps compared to what others can do, but i must do what i must do to be part of the selected ones, so here am i hydruto lions with what i know how to do even with how little and poor it is, i hereby say i wpould like to be part of the chosen ones that would be given whitelist for the upcoming mint </p>
    <p>I would like to be whitelisted so i would be able to assist my fellow lions and follow them into battle while conquering every enemy on out path<br>so please grant me my request and give me wl</p>
